# gl

`obj-gr` loads a graph (a set of vertices and a set of edges) from one
or more `OBJ` files and displays it.

Key commands are:

- ROTATE: Y = `←`/`→` ; X = `↓`|`↑` ; Z = `PgUp`/`PgDn`
- TRANSLATE: X = `Ctl` `←`/`→` ; Y = `Ctl` `↓`|`↑` ; Z= `Ctl` `PgUp`/`PgDn`
- ZOOM OUT/IN: MINOR = `-`/`=` ; MAJOR = `Ctl` `-`/`=`
- INITIAL STATE: `I`
- QUIT: `Q`
